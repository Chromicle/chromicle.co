I&#39;m Ajay Prabhakar, a passionate mobile developer with expertise in iOS, Flutter, and PWA apps. 
      Currently, I work as an SDE 1 at <a href="https://gonuclei.com/" style="color: var(--color-primary-400);">Nuclei</a>, where I lead the IOS team of Core SDK, crafting solutions that power merchant products for banks with active userbase of 210k users per day.

        In my third year, I had the opportunity to participate in <strong>Google Summer of Code</strong>, contributing to open-source projects and discovering 
        the power of community in tech. Later, I ventured into Flutter, where I developed a deep appreciation for UI/UX design using tools like 
        <em>Adobe XD</em> and <em>Figma</em>.</p> <p>Working with startups as a Flutter developer taught me the fast-paced, innovative spirit of the startup ecosystem. 
        Now, at Nuclei, I‚Äôm excited to bring these experiences into building products that make a difference.</p></section> <section class="interests svelte-11u1buu"><h3 class="svelte-11u1buu">When I‚Äôm Not Coding</h3> <p>Outside of development, I‚Äôm an avid traveler and have explored most of South India along with parts of the North.
        I‚Äôm also a bit of a food enthusiast‚ÄîBangalore‚Äôs diverse cuisine is one of my favorite things to explore.</p> <p>Other hobbies include:</p> <ul class="list svelte-11u1buu"><li>Exploring UI and design trends üé®</li> <li>Playing around with new web technologies</li> <li>Contributing to open-source projects üåç</li> <li>Experimenting with photography üì∑</li></ul></section> <h3>Let‚Äôs Connect</h3> <p>Have a project idea or just want to chat?
