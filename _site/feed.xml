&lt;p&gt;Drag or swipe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s actually a &lt;strong&gt;really simple&lt;/strong&gt; way to add these features to RecyclerView. It only requires one class, and it’s already part of the Android Support Library called “ItemTouchHelper”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the help of ItemTouchHelper we can add the swipe and drag features by adding sub class. It’s a subclass of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ItemDecoration.html&quot;&gt;RecyclerView.ItemDecoration&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll demonstrate a simple implementation of ItemTouchHelper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up&quot;&gt;Setting up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing we need is a basic RecyclerView setup. If you haven’t already, update your build.gradle to include the RecyclerView dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:22.2.0'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;by-itemtouchhelper-and-itemtouchhelpercallback&quot;&gt;BY ItemTouchHelper and ItemTouchHelper.Callback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use ItemTouchHelper, you’ll create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/helper/ItemTouchHelper.Callback.html&quot;&gt;ItemTouchHelper.Callback&lt;/a&gt;. This is the interface that allows you to listen for “move” and “swipe” events. It’s also where you are able to control the state of the view selected, and override the default animations. There’s a helper class that you can use if you want a basic implementation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/helper/ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback.html&quot;&gt;SimpleCallback&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main callbacks that we must override to enable basic drag &amp;amp; drop and swipe-to-dismiss are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;getMovementFlags(RecyclerView, ViewHolder) 
onMove(RecyclerView, ViewHolder, ViewHolder) 
onSwiped(ViewHolder, int)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can also use a some of helpers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;isLongPressDragEnabled()
isItemViewSwipeEnabled()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll go through them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Override  
public int getMovementFlags(RecyclerView recyclerView,   
        RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder) {  
    int dragFlags = ItemTouchHelper.UP | ItemTouchHelper.DOWN;  
    int swipeFlags = ItemTouchHelper.START | ItemTouchHelper.END;  
    return makeMovementFlags(dragFlags, swipeFlags);  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help you get the direction. You must override &lt;strong&gt;getMovementFlags&lt;/strong&gt;() to specify which directions of drags and swipes. Use the helper &lt;strong&gt;ItemTouchHelper.makeMovementFlags(int, int)&lt;/strong&gt; to build the returned flags. We’re enabling dragging and swiping in both directions here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Override  
public boolean isLongPressDragEnabled() {  
    return true;  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ItemTouchHelper can be used for drag &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; swipe (or vice versa), so you must designate exactly what you wish to support. Implementations should return true from &lt;strong&gt;isLongPressDragEnabled()&lt;/strong&gt; will detect when we long press the any item in recyclerView&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Override  
public boolean isItemViewSwipeEnabled() {  
    return true;  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to enable swiping we have to return true from &lt;strong&gt;isItemViewSwipeEnabled&lt;/strong&gt;().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;onMove()&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;onSwiped()&lt;/strong&gt; are used to notify anything of updating data. So first we’ll create an interface that allows us to pass these event callbacks back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ItemTouchHelperAdapter {  
  
    void onItemMove(int fromPosition, int toPosition);  
  
    void onItemDismiss(int position);  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ItemTouchHelper.java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class RecyclerListAdapter extends   
        RecyclerView.Adapter&amp;lt;ItemViewHolder&amp;gt;   
        implements ItemTouchHelperAdapter {

@Override  
public void onItemDismiss(int position) {  
    mItems.remove(position);  
    notifyItemRemoved(position);  
}  
  
@Override  
public boolean onItemMove(int fromPosition, int toPosition) {  
    if (fromPosition &amp;lt; toPosition) {  
        for (int i = fromPosition; i &amp;lt; toPosition; i++) {  
            Collections.swap(mItems, i, i + 1);  
        }  
    } else {  
        for (int i = fromPosition; i &amp;gt; toPosition; i--) {  
            Collections.swap(mItems, i, i - 1);  
        }  
    }  
    notifyItemMoved(fromPosition, toPosition);  
    return true;  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very important to call &lt;strong&gt;notifyItemRemoved()&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;notifyItemMoved()&lt;/strong&gt; so the Adapter can identify the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can go back to building our &lt;strong&gt;SimpleItemTouchHelperCallback&lt;/strong&gt; as we still must override onMove() and onSwiped(). First add a constructor and a field for the Adapter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;private final ItemTouchHelperAdapter mAdapter;  
  
public SimpleItemTouchHelperCallback(  
        ItemTouchHelperAdapter adapter) {  
    mAdapter = adapter;  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then override the remaining events and notify the adapter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Override  
public boolean **onMove**(RecyclerView recyclerView,   
        RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder,   
        RecyclerView.ViewHolder target) {

mAdapter.onItemMove(viewHolder.getAdapterPosition(),   
            target.getAdapterPosition());

    return true;  
}

@Override  
public void onSwiped(RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder,   
        int direction) {  
    mAdapter.onItemDismiss(viewHolder.getAdapterPosition());  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our Callback, we can create our ItemTouchHelper and call &lt;strong&gt;attachToRecyclerView(RecyclerView):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ItemTouchHelper.Callback callback =   
new SimpleItemTouchHelperCallback(adapter);  
ItemTouchHelper touchHelper= new ItemTouchHelper(callback);  
touchHelper.attachToRecyclerView(recyclerView);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Happy coding :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ajay prabhakar</name><email>ajayprabhakar369@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day out at munroe</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019-06-30-day-out-at-munroe/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day out at munroe" /><published>2019-06-30T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/day-out-at-munroe</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019-06-30-day-out-at-munroe/">&lt;p&gt;Recently the amFOSS club members planned to keep a day off and plan for a trip. Upon Vipin Sir’s suggestion, six of us went to Munroe Island and spent a whole day there. I would like to share the experience of the trip in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munroe Island or Mundrothuruthu is an inland island group formed at the confluence of the backwaters of the Ashtamudi Lake and Kallada River. We went to the Island by taking a train from Oachira to Munroturuttu railway station. Just costed 10 rupees, very cheap I know. 🙊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-rows=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked all the way from the railway station to the village, taking pictures in between and having fun. Our first stop was the Kalluvila Sreekrishna Temple. We saw this place in the Google Maps and planned to visit the temple. :innocent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-rows=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temple was so peaceful and serene. It is located on the backwaters and the whole view was absolutely fanstastic. The temple is really beautiful which is perfectly standing on the banks of the backwaters. We stayed at the place for sometime and enjoyed the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-rows=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/13.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked along the backwaters and by this time we are already hungry. We decided to eat the authentic Kerala fish food and selected a place according to the local’s opinion. We went to Ambu Lal’s Hotel. We were stuck on the other side of the backwater, he then came and took us to his place in his boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-rows=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/18.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/19.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the best lunch so far. The perfect Kerala feast. I ate Karimeen, a type of freshwater fish, for the first time. It was really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-rows=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/20.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/21.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we planned to go for boating after sometime. Untill they boat had arrived, we went out for a small walk to see what is around and found a really good view point there. We sat for sometime and we tried fishing too. But yeah we didn’t catch one, sed life. 😶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-rows=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/23.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/22.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went for boating later on. We got onto the small boat and we got paddles to row the boat. We were boating for two hours after that but it didn’t feel two hours has passed. We never got tired of rowing. We went through many waterways and the experience was absolutely unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-columns=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/30.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/31.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/32.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few videos too, which I couldn’t upload it because of the size constraint. You can view them here in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/EssbapdMEdvVY4s39&quot;&gt;Blog Photos Album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; data-columns=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/35.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/37.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/36.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/assets/day-out-at-munroe/38.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two hours of boating over there, we returned back to the place had lunch. We had snacks over there and the etta dropped us at the railway station and we headed back to Amritapuri, with the beautiful experiences of the day at Munroe. Next on list - Thanjavur, Gokarna and many more. 😁&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ajay prabhakar</name><email>ajayprabhakar369@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Recently the amFOSS club members planned to keep a day off and plan for a trip.

While some recent ones are getting very popular, older ones are also holding their ground. Interestingly enough older ones are becoming mature as well whether or not they want to be. They are now getting called at the principal’s office and stuff. Seems like they’re now being treated like teenage crossed human beings who are anticipated to be more responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, back to the point for today — &lt;strong&gt;Complexity of Usage&lt;/strong&gt;. I don’t know about others, it takes quite some effort for me to gain the basic understanding of the latest apps. Let me give some example. Several months ago I was trying to figure out how to add a story in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I was going all over the icons and options and it was a thorny way to be honest. After 8-10 minutes of uttermost struggle, I was finally able to figure it out. And it was indeed an &lt;strong&gt;Aha&lt;/strong&gt; moment. Maybe that’s how the senior citizens feel when they figure out some &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; stuff and now I know the feelings. With some sheer confidence by my side after cracking such complicated puzzle, I headed straight to the play store and installed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snapchat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; without any hesitation in mind. Only if I knew what was waiting ahead. The whole thing was complicated, the whole damn thing. Nothing was making any sense to me. I was ratted and completely demolished. But being a true supporter of Bangladesh National Cricket team, I didn’t lose hope. The optimistic part somewhere inside kept me from uninstalling it in hope that someday I’ll come again and conquer. I’m really happy to announce that &lt;strong&gt;someday&lt;/strong&gt; came true last week. It was an absolute &lt;strong&gt;Eureka&lt;/strong&gt; moment rest assured. I wouldn’t say everything makes complete sense now but I have the basic drills of doing stuffs. I’m in an &lt;strong&gt;okay-but-why&lt;/strong&gt; state now and in the process of convincing myself that’s the way it should be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ajay prabhakar</name><email>ajayprabhakar369@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Catching up with the apps, more appropriately the networking apps has become quite a challenge lately.

After careful consideration I have figured out at least one aspect of my life where I was rather elaborate. It is none other than the exam papers up until I started my undergrad. “The customer is always right” and it’s even more prominent when the consumer is going to mark you. And also if the pen is mightier than the sword then the mark point must also be tougher than the gun point, right? That’s why we’re maybe even more concerned than the writers about the significance of the namings of their literatures. We’re more thoughtful about what they tried to mean with some specific lines and explain them in a way maybe they never even thought of. I’ve always wondered about the way they’d react if they could come to see our bisection of their writings. Would they be able to keep up with our level of expectation if they’d know what we think? Or would they go like, “We haven’t thought that far when writing, please believe!”? I guess we’ll never know the answer and on our defense, we were on mark point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life took another minor version bump after figuring out the fact that it is possible to set the timer to :90(90 seconds) instead of 1:30(1 minute and 30 seconds) in microwave oven(at least it’s true for the one I use) and that’s what I actually wanted to say this week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ajay prabhakar</name><email>ajayprabhakar369@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">I don’t have much in mind this week.

I guess we’ll never know the answer and on our defense, we were on mark point.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Example post 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018-12-02-week-48/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Example post 2" /><published>2018-12-02T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-12-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/week-48</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018-12-02-week-48/">&lt;p&gt;Just came to understand lately that all lands are eventually islands.

&lt;p&gt;Rabindranath Tagore died in 1941. India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh got independence respectively in 1947, 1948 and 1971. India’s and Bangladesh’s national anthems are written by Rabindranath Tagore while Sri Lanka’s national anthem is inspired by his work. So basically he’s written national anthems for the nations that were yet to be born without even knowing their names. What a visionary and what an absolute spoiler. I wonder if he put any “Spoiler Alert” tag before his compositions. Otherwise the British Empire mustn’t be very happy about it considering the amount of anger people convey these days when they get spoiler for just a movie or a TV show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the new YouTube Music app is on the market and the monthly subscription fee for the premium version costs more than the monthly subscription fee of Netflix or Amazon Prime. Is the music just gonna play on the mobile or the singers gonna come home for some live action as well? What am I missing here? YouTube Music and chill is on it’s way maybe!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ajay prabhakar</name><email>ajayprabhakar369@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Just came to understand lately that all lands are eventually islands.
