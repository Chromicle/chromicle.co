I'm Ajay Prabhakar, a designer, a programmer and a photographer.

### Me as a learner :mortar_board:
I started learning about Android during my freshman year on a summer course with udacity.   
  
Learning coding from scratch, studying concepts of IOT, participating in various Hackathons, and exploring the world, undertaking real industry projects and comming back to university to learn more. That's the journey I've been through. And I really enjoy learning in this fast-evolving world with exciting technologies comming out every day.

### Me as a programmer :octocat: 
"I am a programmer contributing to the opensource projects." Every time when I am learning to use other tools, reading the document and thinking about how much effort I saved by standing on the shoulders of giants, I always feel the most appreciation for those developers. And I feel that's what I'm trying to achieve, to write beautiful code, to bring efficiency and to contribute to the community.  

### Me as a photographer :camera_flash:
What I like to do most in my spare time is to pick up my camera and go outside to capture the moment I like. Actually I'd rather think it's the moment that seized me. Just when the moment comes, I know nothing better than smile and press the shutter on the camera. I really enjoy the incredible creativity of nature that presents us with always different scenery. I wait for sunrise and sunset, I chase the moon and the star, I climb mount and cross the sea, to appreciate the moments that nature seizes me.

### What I'm Doing Now (Updated on Jul. 22, 2020)
- Android developer at [cometchat](https://www.cometchat.com/).
- Exploring UI designing with Figma and adobe XD, illustrator.
- Engaging on some personal projects with help of [amFOSS](https://github.com/amfoss).
- Practising algorithms and data structure by solving problems on Codeforces & Hackerrank.
