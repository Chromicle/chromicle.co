I"G<p>I used to work with MVP pattern until now. However, when Google released nice-to-use components like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ViewModel</code> along with the <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/"><strong>Android Jetpack</strong></a>, I have tried to work with <strong>MVVM</strong> pattern. In this article, we will see how can we use the MVVM pattern with <a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit">Retrofit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger">Dagger 2</a>.</p>
